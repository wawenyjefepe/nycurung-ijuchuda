Overview
The poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai&#039;s No Longer Human narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human beings. Oba Yozo&#039;s attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a &quot;clown&quot; to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness.
