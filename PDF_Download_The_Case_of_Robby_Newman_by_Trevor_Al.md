The Case of Robby Newman, the latest project of screenwriter Joseph Wilson, tells the story of Adriana Garcia and her soon to be stepbrother, Robby Newman. One is your classic good girl dating a bad boy, the other spends his time online. As one would expect, tensions are high and soon things come to a head when Adriana accidentally kills Robby. In an act of desperation, she takes the body to a secret land under the advisement of a family friend. The next morning he&amp;#039;s back, but he&amp;#039;s not the same. As Adriana tries to put things back to normal, she notices herself beginning to change just as stepbrother.
