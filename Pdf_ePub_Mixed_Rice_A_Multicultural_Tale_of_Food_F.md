A simple family meal reveals the power of mindfulness and healthy communication in this colorful children‚Äôs book celebrating the diverse cultures that shape our identities
 
 When Joya‚Äôs parents disagree on what to eat, she must search high in the sky and deep within to find the glue that holds her multicultural family together
 
 Mixed Rice by Sophie Dipti Sarkar is an enchanting and culturally rich picture book for children ages 4-8 that delves into the heart of a multi-racial Asian family&amp;#039;s daily life, centered around a seemingly simple yet profound question: Which rice to cook for dinner? As young Joya grapples with choosing between gohan and basmati rice, her parents&amp;#039; divergent preferences spark a heated debate, revealing deeper longings for connection and belonging. Through the conflict over rice, Sarkar deftly weaves a narrative that is both relatable and educational, making Mixed Rice an ideal read for families seeking to foster understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity.
 
 Beyond its engaging storyline, Mixed Rice serves as a practical guide in mindful communication and conflict resolution inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh‚Äôs teachings and offers two recipes from Joya&amp;#039;s family as well as space to write down your own!
 
 ‚ÄúA delightful and wise story that shows children of all ages how to be compassionate and take skillful action in moments of family conflict.‚Äù‚ÄîKaira Jewel Lingo, author of We Were Made for These Times and editor of Planting Seeds: Practicing Mindfulness with Children
