Overview
In this josei romantic comedy manga, marriage comes before love for a pair of total opposites!
 
 For the sake of her familyâ€™s farm, Hanabata Mikan has been arranged to marry the heir of a food and holdings company, Yonoi Tsukihiko. Mikan refuses, saying she already has a man she loves, only for Tsukihiko to laugh in her face! He finds romance and love unnecessary and has no intentions of changing his views. But Mikan canâ€™t get married to a man who doesnâ€™t believe in loveâ€¦right? Is this pair doomed to rot, or can a love ripen between two total opposites?
